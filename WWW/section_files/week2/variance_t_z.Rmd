$$\text{variance of } z \text{ distribution } = 1$$
$$\text{variance of } t \text{ distribution }= \frac{df}{df-2}$$

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw(base_size = 18)) 

sequence = 2:40
variance_t = sequence/(sequence-2)

data = data.frame(df=sequence, var_t=variance_t)

ggplot(data=data, aes(x=df, y=var_t)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_hline(y=1, color='red', linetype='longdash')
```

### As the degrees of freedom increase, the variance of $t$ becomes more like that of $z$ (i.e., equal to 1). Thus, the distribution of $t$ becomes closer to that of $z$ as the sample size increases!
