  A two-way chi-square test confirmed a significant interaction between experimental condition and leadership style, χ2(4, N=180)= 28.66, p<.01. Pearson chi-square tests were then conducted to detect differences in participants' voting as a function of MS. MS did not have a statistically significant effect on the number of votes for the task-oriented leader, χ2(1, N=180)=0.28, p=.60. However, as predicted, MS participants were significantly more likely than exam-salient participants to vote for the charismatic leader, χ2(1, N=180)=20.83, p<.01. Conversely, participants were less likely to vote for the relationship-oriented leader when primed with thoughts of death versus thoughts of an upcoming exam, χ2(1, N=180)=7.56, p<.01. Thus, participants' votes for specific candidates were completely parallel (as one would hope they would be) with their evaluations of the candidates reported in the previous section
